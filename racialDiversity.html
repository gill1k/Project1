      <h1>Racial Diversity</h1> 
       
         <br>Indian is a repository of multiplicity and plurality of cultures. India has sheltered various outside elements into its florishing culture. It has accomodated a large number of migratory races from Western and Eastern directions. Most of the Indians are descendants of immigrants from across Himalayas. During 1891 Census operation, Herbert Risley had classified the people of India into seven racial types.
