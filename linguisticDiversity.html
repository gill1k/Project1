     <h1>Linguistic Diversity</h1>
        <p><br>India is a country of many languages.Linguistic Researchers have suggested that in older times when there were no means of transportation, mobility of people was very less. Therefore, communities were confined to a very small area and they would speak their own language and dialect. According to Census operation of 1961, India has total of 1,652 languages and dialects.Since most of these languages were spoken by very few people most of the languages were regarded as spurious. 8'h Schedule of Constitution of India only recognizes 22 languages.
            Among these 22 languages Hindi is the most spoken language of India.
